# About
Phinix is a total rewrite of [Longwelwind's Phi mod](https://github.com/longwelwind/phi) that allows players to chat and trade items with each other within the game.  
It boasts improvements such as:
 - Chat message timestamps
 - Unread message alerts
 - Two-way trading GUI
 - Asynchronous trades (no need to respond straight away!)
 - Toggle-able name and chat formatting
 - ...and a bunch of other stuff that I'm sure I've forgotten to mention here

# Installation
## Client
1. Download `PhinixClient.zip` from the [releases page](https://github.com/PhinixTeam/Phinix/releases/latest)
2. Extract it into your `RimWorld/Mods` folder
(If you bought the game through Steam, this should be under somewhere like `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\RimWorld\`)
3. Download and install [HugsLib](https://github.com/UnlimitedHugs/RimworldHugsLib/releases/latest)
4. Load **HugsLib first**, *then* Phinix
5. Restart your game and you should be good to go

## Server
See the [wiki page](https://github.com/PhinixTeam/Phinix/wiki/Hosting-a-server) for server installation.

### Docker
There are automated server builds available through [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/phinixteam/phinix).  
See the [wiki page](https://github.com/PhinixTeam/Phinix/wiki/Hosting-a-server#docker-container) for more details.

# Usage
## Client
1. Load up a save or create a new one
2. Open the `Chat` tab toward the bottom-right
3. Click on `Settings` and enter the address and port of the server you want to connect to
4. Click `Connect`   
The chat panel should change from being greyed-out to a blue background. The user list on the right of the panel will update to show you and anyone else that is online.

## Server
1. Open `server.conf` with a text editor and change the settings as you see fit
2. Run `PhiServer.exe`
3. *(Optional)* Enter `help` to see all available commands

# FAQ
See the [wiki page](https://github.com/PhinixTeam/Phinix/wiki/FAQ) for a list of frequently-asked questions and answers.

# Developers
## Setting up your environment
### Game DLLs
The client project depends on several assemblies from RimWorld's data directory (they can be found in `<RimWorldDir>/RimWorldXXX_Data/Managed/`):
- `Assembly-CSharp.dll`
- `UnityEngine.dll`
- `UnityEngine.CoreModule.dll`
- `UnityEngine.IMGUIModule.dll`
- `UnityEngine.TextRenderingModule.dll`

All of these need to be present in the `GameDlls/` directory to build the client project. Either copy them in directly or make a symbolic link.

If you only want to build the common projects and/or the server project, you can build the solution using the `TravisCI` build profile which does not require the game assemblies.

### Protobuf for Packet Compilation
Network data packets are defined in [Protobuf](https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers/), a structured, language-neutral de/serialisation framework designed by Google. If you want to make any changes to these packets, you will need a copy of [protoc](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/tag/v3.11.4) with C# support. As of March 3rd 2020, Phinix uses Protobuf v3.11.4.
